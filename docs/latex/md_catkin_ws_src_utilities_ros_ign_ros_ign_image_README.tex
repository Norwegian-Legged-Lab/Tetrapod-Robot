This package provides a unidirectional bridge for images from Ignition to R\+OS. The bridge subscribes to Ignition image messages ({\ttfamily ignition\+::msgs\+::\+Image}) and republishes them to R\+OS using \href{http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport}{\texttt{ image\+\_\+transport}}.

For compressed images, install \href{http://wiki.ros.org/compressed_image_transport}{\texttt{ compressed\+\_\+image\+\_\+transport}} and the bridge will publish {\ttfamily /compressed} images. The same goes for other {\ttfamily image\+\_\+transport} plugins.
